            <p>We sit facing each other, I raise my line of sight to glare at you. 
                .</p>
            <p> My knees bent at a 24 degree angle, with my back pressed against the thick layer of glass. You sit similarly, our legs woven together in such a grotesque fashion. </p>
            <p>The ridge of your nose, and the shape of your face are blurry. After all, I haven’t seen you in 3 years now. And for 3 years now, under the bluelight, everyone is ugly in your way. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Under the water exists a memory of us which was never conceived. Through the glass was not a school of fish, just you and me. 
                
                </p>
            <p> When I move, my head would hit the lid. You’d notice, then ask me to stay a little longer –– did that also include in my consciousness and everywhere in between? </p>\
            <p> We sit across from each other inside a fish tank. </p>
            <p>  I’m forced to see your shape, your fragile shape was projected, blurring my future and memories. You spoil me with your hungry, humiliating gaze scavenging everything–  body, chest, legs, and face. </p>
