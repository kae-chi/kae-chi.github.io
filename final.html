            <p>To be creative is to channel the inertia of raw emotion seeping directly from the heart, to create, build, imagine, or project a vision of the heart. This is what it means to have the spirit of creativity.</p>
            <p>Build a vessel to house the emotion which would otherwise dissipate. That very raw emotion which would evaporate to nothing. One which could never be felt, for it would be impossible to create the moment, the intensity, or a one to one replication.
